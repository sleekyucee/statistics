# Statistics Project

This repository contains a statistics project that focuses on descriptive and inferential statistics using a dataset of Covid-19 vaccinations in Obio Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria. The project showcases various statistical analyses, including mean, median, range, quantiles, covariance, correlation, outliers, and inferential statistics with a specific emphasis on estimation through confidence intervals.

## Overview

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Describes, displays, and summarizes the basic parameters or characteristics of the Covid-19 vaccination dataset, providing insights into the distribution and central tendencies.

- **Inferential Statistics:** Draws conclusions and makes predictions based on the observations or data from the Covid-19 vaccination records. Useful for making estimations and testing hypotheses.

- **Linear Regression Model:** Demonstrates a linear regression model to predict the dependent variable from the independent variable in the context of Covid-19 vaccinations.

## Dataset

The dataset (`datasets/obio-akpor-covid-19-1st-dose-moderna.csv`) was obtained from records of Covid-19 vaccinations in Obio Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria. The data spans a period from August 2021 to October 2021 for first-dose Moderna vaccinations.

## Project Structure

- **datasets/:** Contains the dataset file `obio-akpor-covid-19-1st-dose-moderna.csv`.

- **notebooks/:** Includes the Jupyter notebook `descriptive-and-inferential-statistics.ipynb` where the statistical analyses and linear regression modeling are performed.

- **slides/:** Contains the PowerPoint presentation `descriptive-and-inferential-statistics.pptx` summarizing the key findings and insights from the statistical analyses.

## Getting Started

To explore the statistical analyses and findings:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/descriptive-and-inferential-statistics.ipynb`.
2. Review the code, analysis, and visualizations.

For a concise overview, check the PowerPoint presentation in `slides/descriptive-and-inferential-statistics.pptx`.
